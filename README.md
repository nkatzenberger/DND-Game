# DND-Game
Local Player Vs Player game based on the rules of Dungeons and Dragons
This project was made in December 2021 as part of a final for a class teaching C++. 
This is a game run in a terminal, so there is no actual envrionment to look at. This design choice was based on how actual DND is played. This version can be used for character PVP in an actual DND game.
Type any number for a randomized seed to be set in the environment to play in.
Write name of player and action to take to progress.
